Issue Summary:
- Duration:
  - Start Time: January 15, 2023, 08:45 AM (UTC)
  - End Time: January 15, 2023, 11:30 AM (UTC)
- Impact:
  - The outage affected the core functionality of a very basic program
  - Users experienced intermittent service disruptions and a significant decrease in responsiveness.
  - Approximately 40% of users were directly impacted.

Timeline:
- Detection Time:
  - January 15, 2023, 08:45 AM (UTC)
- Detection Method:
  - An automated monitoring alert triggered due to a significant increase in API response times.
- Actions Taken:
  - My partner and I initiated an immediate investigation into the backend infrastructure.
- Misleading Paths:
  - Investigated network configurations and server logs.
  - Deviated into an exploration of recent code deployments for potential bugs.
- Escalation:
  - Incident was escalated to the Systems Reliability Team (SRT).
- Resolution:
  - Discovered that the root cause was an unexpected surge in concurrent user activity leading to resource exhaustion.
  - Implemented temporary load balancing measures to lift immediate strain on servers.
  - Conducted a rolling restart of servers to ensure proper distribution of incoming requests.

Root Cause and Resolution:
- Root Cause:
  - Increased user activity combined with substanbdard server resource allocation led to performance degradation.
  - Lack of efficient monitoring for real-time server load and user activity spikes contributed to the oversight.
- Resolution:
  - Implemented dynamic auto-scaling for server resources to handle varying user loads more effectively.
  - Enhanced monitoring and alerting systems to provide real-time insights into server performance.
  - Conducted a thorough review of database query efficiency and optimized critical queries for improved response times.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
- Improvements/Fixes:
  - Enhance load testing scenarios to simulate and prepare for unexpected spikes in user activity.
  - Implement proactive monitoring for server resource utilization and user engagement patterns.
  - Conduct regular reviews of system architecture to identify potential scalability bottlenecks.
- Tasks:
  - Task 1: Update documentation to include detailed procedures for handling sudden increases in user activity.
  - Task 2: Implement automated scaling policies to adjust resources based on real-time demand.
  - Task 3: Conduct training sessions for the operations team on interpreting and responding to monitoring alerts promptly.
  - Task 4: Establish a post-incident review process to analyze and learn from each outage, improving overall system resilience.

Conclusion:
This lack of concentration incident emphasized on the critical importance of robust monitoring, efficient escalation procedures, and proactive system scaling. By addressing the identified corrective measures.
